deine_nachricht: "Subject: Retreat Booking Inquiry\r\n\r\nHello Team,\r\n\r\nHappy New Year! I hope it’s okay to reach out in English, as German is not my native language.\r\n\r\nI’m a certified somatic yoga & dance teacher based in Berlin, and over the past three years, I’ve organized five retreats. I’m currently planning my sixth retreat for 2026, which will focus on nourishment for the body and soul. I’ll be collaborating with a food duo called Treats for this retreat. We already hosted a successful Nourished Retreat with Treats in November 2025, which had 22 participants.\r\n\r\nA friend of mine attended a retreat at your space and highly recommended it. We’re expecting between 12 to 25 people, depending on bookings, and I would love to learn more about your availability, booking process, and cancellation policy. Additionally, could you please confirm if it would be possible for us to handle all the catering for the retreat?\r\n\r\nWe are still flexible with the retreat dates but most likely somewhere in the autumn between in late september and mid November. \r\n\r\nThank you so much for your time and assistance!\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nJuliana Alvarez"
