deine_nachricht: "Hello,\r\n\r\nWe found your beautiful space recommended from friends. And I now wanted to check with you availabilities for our upcoming \"Soul Family Gathering\". \r\nThe dates circle around the 30th of July, including the weekend, but we are flexible if its gonna be 4 till 6 days around the weekend. Depending on the capacity of the location and pricing of course. \r\nWe would need space for 80-150 people to host -  meaning to sleep over for 4-5. Nights. We don’t necessarily need that many beds, as it’s also ok for us to camp on the ground if needed. \r\n\r\nOur Event is called „Soul Family Gathering“ and it would be the 4th edition of this kind of meeting. Its a conscious meeting with open minded people coming together in exploration of community and self expression. \r\nFocus is the self sustained community structure with very flat hierarchies. We sustain ourself autarc and co-create in harmony and togetherness. Its not a commercial oriented gathering, rather a gathering of friends. So our budget is quite low as our goals are not of making money out of this event. We are very spiritual oriented and connect through prayer and embodied practices with ourself and the land around us. So the land we will gather is always very important and the energy we will find there. The land is usually quite happy about our work we do. Nature around is key and enough space to breathe and be. \r\nThe wisdom of indigenous from different corners of the world is also a main point of our gathering. We usually have at least one elder with us from another country like Colombia or Guatemala and we will also this time integrate our German elders more. \r\nIn case its raining we would need a group room inside…I would say at least 80/100qm. And we are happy if there is some tent or other kind of space outside available. Fireplace is a must…but we can create one as well. The rest I would say we merge together with the location and see what is possible in a more detailed discussion.\r\nWe usually cook ourself (in that case we would need a big kitchen), but we are also open to discuss other options for this, in case there is something offered already. \r\n\r\nLooking forward to hear back from you with more ideas.\r\nLove,\r\nTiziana"
